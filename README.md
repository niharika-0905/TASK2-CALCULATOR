SIMPLE CALCULATOR

This is a **basic web calculator** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division directly in their browser.


=> Features

Clean and responsive calculator UI
Supports +, –, ×, ÷ operations
Clear (`C`) button to reset input
`=` button to calculate result
Simple JavaScript logic using `eval()`

=> How It Works

appendToDisplay(value): Adds the pressed button value to the display.

clearDisplay(): Clears the input field.

calculateResult(): Evaluates the expression using eval() and displays the result.


=> Note
This is a simple project for learning and practice. For production use, avoid eval() due to security risks — use a proper math parser instead.
